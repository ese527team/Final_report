# Final_report
This is the final code project for the team Hao and Run.
The file advanced_RF.ipynb is a combined version for all the models. To reduce the time cost of running sequentially in one files, we divide 4 models into 4 different parts as KNN, MLP, LSTM and SVM. But the content are the same and these two kind of files have the same performance. The running result is shown in the divided files.
The original data is data.cvs, we conduct data processing and get data_ap.cvs. And then we conduct the data analysis in the rest files.


PS: For MLP code, the error occurs only for writing the prediction results to csv, but the prediction is completed and showing the accuracy above error, which is according with our report. And under the error the writing process is been re-conducted and output correctly. For check use, we upload a new MLP that do not have the warning but might have slightly different accuracy due to the randomness of selection. The new file is called MLP_NEW.ipynb.
