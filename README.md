# Final_report
This is the final code project for the team Hao and Run.
The file advanced_RF.ipynb is a combined version for all the models. To reduce the time cost of running sequentially in one files, we divide 4 models into 4 different parts as KNN, MLP, LSTM and SVM. But the content are the same and these two kind of files have the same performance. The running result is shown in the divided files.
